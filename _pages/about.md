I am a PhD student at Data Science Institute, Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Yike Guo. Previously, I received my MSc degree in Computer Science from Imperial College London, MSc degree in Mechatronics from University of Southampton, and BEng degree in Mechanical Engineering from Zhejiang University.

My research interest is deep generative models towards creativity in computer vision.
